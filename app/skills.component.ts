            I'm currently working with Javascript frameworks Angular2 and Ionic2 for
            web and mobile application development.
            
            I've also recently adapted to using TypeScript along with an appropriate
            transpiler so that I can write es2015/es6 strongly typed Javascript and 
            still run in all supported browsers.
        </p>
    </div>
    `,
})

export class SkillsComponent {
